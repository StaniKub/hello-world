# hello-world
my first repository

I'm learning Javascript / HTML / CSS languages, trying to make something useful with my life.

I like reading books, science fiction mostly (last read: Dune by Frank Herbert), playing games (last played: World of Warcraft) and while not at the computer I like to spend time outdoors hiking and camping.

I'm not really consistent yet, but I'm finding my pace.
